# Android Crash Fixes for StageTracker Pro

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. File System Operations
- **Problem**: Direct file operations without proper error handling causing crashes on Android
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks and validation
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `mobile-app/src/screens/TrackManagerScreen.tsx`
  - `mobile-app/src/providers/DatabaseProvider.tsx`
  - `mobile-app/src/providers/AudioEngineProvider.tsx`

### 2. Storage Permission Checks
- **Problem**: App attempting file operations without verifying storage access
- **Solution**: Added storage permission validation before file operations
- **Implementation**: Pre-flight checks for document directory accessibility

### 3. File Path Sanitization
- **Problem**: Special characters in filenames causing Android file system issues
- **Solution**: Sanitize filenames by replacing special characters with underscores
- **Regex**: `/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]/g` replaced with `_`

### 4. File Operation Timeouts
- **Problem**: Long-running file operations causing ANR (Application Not Responding)
- **Solution**: Added 30-second timeout for file copy operations and 15-second timeout for audio loading
- **Implementation**: `Promise.race()` with timeout promises

### 5. File Verification Steps
- **Problem**: Corrupted or incomplete file copies causing audio playback crashes
- **Solution**: Multi-step verification process:
  - Source file accessibility check
  - Destination file existence and size validation
  - Audio file loading verification
  - Cleanup of failed operations

### 6. Database Transaction Safety
- **Problem**: Database operations failing without proper error handling
- **Solution**: Wrapped all database operations in try-catch blocks with proper error propagation

### 7. Audio Loading Robustness
- **Problem**: Audio.Sound.createAsync() failing on corrupted or inaccessible files
- **Solution**: 
  - File existence and size validation before audio loading
  - Timeout protection for audio loading operations
  - Graceful handling of audio loading failures

## Key Android-Specific Improvements

1. **Storage Access Validation**: Check document directory accessibility before operations
2. **Filename Sanitization**: Remove problematic characters for Android file system
3. **Operation Timeouts**: Prevent ANR with reasonable timeout limits  
4. **File Verification**: Multi-step validation of file operations
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operation even if individual files fail
6. **Comprehensive Logging**: Better error reporting for debugging

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various audio file formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG)
2. Test with files containing special characters in names
3. Test with large audio files (>100MB)
4. Test on devices with limited storage space
5. Test import interruption scenarios (app backgrounding, calls, etc.)
6. Test with corrupted audio files
7. Test storage permission scenarios

## Performance Optimizations

- File operations run with timeouts to prevent blocking
- Individual file failures don't stop the entire import process
- Better memory management with proper cleanup on failures
- Improved user feedback with detailed error messages
