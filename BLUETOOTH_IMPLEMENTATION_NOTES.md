# Bluetooth MIDI Implementation Notes
## Date: Sep 21, 2025

## Files Modified
1. `client/src/lib/android-ble-midi.ts` - BLE MIDI adapter
2. `client/src/hooks/useMidiDevices.ts` - MIDI devices hook  
3. `client/src/components/midi-device-manager.tsx` - UI component

## Original Implementation (Before Changes)
- BLE MIDI only works on Android devices (line 71 in useMidiDevices.ts checks `browserInfo.isAndroidBrowser`)
- Single unified list of all MIDI devices
- No auto-reconnect functionality
- No "BLE" suffix on Bluetooth device names

## Changes Made
1. Renamed AndroidBleMidiAdapter to BleMidiAdapter (supports all platforms)
2. Removed Android-only restriction in shouldUseBleAdapter
3. Added two-tab UI (MIDI Devices and Bluetooth MIDI)
4. Implemented localStorage for auto-reconnect
5. Added "BLE" suffix to Bluetooth device names
6. Added browser compatibility detection

## Reverting Instructions
If issues occur, revert these specific changes:
1. In `useMidiDevices.ts` line 71: Add back `if (!browserInfo.isAndroidBrowser) return false;`
2. In `midi-device-manager.tsx`: Remove tabs UI, restore unified list
3. Remove localStorage code for auto-reconnect
4. Remove "BLE" suffix code
5. Rename BleMidiAdapter back to AndroidBleMidiAdapter

## Key Code Snippets for Reverting
```javascript
// Original Android-only check (line 71 useMidiDevices.ts):
if (!browserInfo.isAndroidBrowser) return false;

// Original class name:
export class AndroidBleMidiAdapter
```

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Regular MIDI devices still work
- [x] Bluetooth devices appear in Bluetooth tab
- [x] Auto-reconnect works on refresh  
- [x] "BLE" suffix appears correctly
- [x] Firefox/Safari show appropriate message

## Fixes Applied After Review
- Fixed BLE device ID prefixing to ensure all BLE devices have "BLE:" prefix
- Fixed auto-reconnect localStorage to clear when no devices connected
- BLE devices now added directly to state instead of relying on refresh
