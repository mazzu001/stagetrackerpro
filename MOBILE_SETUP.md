- **Multi-track Support**: Up to 6 tracks per song with individual controls

## Usage Flow

1. **Create Songs**: Tap "New Song" to add songs to your library
2. **Add Tracks**: Use "Track Manager" to upload audio files from device

4. **Mixing Controls**: Individual volume, mute, solo for each track
5. **Lyrics Display**: Synchronized lyrics with auto-scrolling

## Audio File Support

- MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG formats

## Development Notes

- Use physical device for file upload testing
- Background audio requires custom development build
- All data persists locally between app sessions

## Migration from Web Version

Your existing web version data can be exported and manually imported to the mobile app if needed. The mobile app uses the same core data structure but stores everything locally for performance.

## Performance Benefits

ðŸš€ **Instant Loading**: Local files eliminate network delays
ðŸ”’ **Reliable**: No internet outages can interrupt performance  
âš¡ **Fast Mixing**: Native audio engine for real-time performance
ðŸ“± **Mobile Optimized**: Touch controls designed for stage use

The mobile app is now your primary platform for stage performance!
