# RESTORE POINT 22 - BEFORE CLIENT-SIDE CONVERSION

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** Successfully deployed to Firebase hosting with authentication removed

## Current State
- ✅ Authentication completely removed (mobile app model)
- ✅ Firebase hosting deployment working
- ✅ Frontend loads at: https://stagetrackerpro-a193d.web.app
- ✅ Backend API calls present but failing (expected)

## What Works
- React frontend with professional tier always enabled
- Local storage for user settings
- Audio processing and MIDI APIs
- Static file serving

## What's Failing
- All /api/* endpoints return HTML instead of JSON
- Song upload functionality
- Server-side data persistence

## Next Phase
Starting Phase 3A: Convert to 100% client-side for mobile app packaging

## Backup Files to Watch
- client/src/hooks/useLocalStorage.ts (authentication replacement)
- client/src/App.tsx (main routing)
- client/src/contexts/StorageContext.tsx (data management)
- All components with API calls

## Rollback Instructions
If Phase 3A fails:
1. git checkout HEAD~1 (if committed)
2. Or restore from this backup point
3. Run: npm run dev (to test locally)
4. Run: npm run deploy:firebase (to redeploy)
