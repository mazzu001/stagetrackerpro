To initialize the Web MIDI API smoothly — without freezing or UI lag — you’ll want to follow a few best practices that balance performance, user experience, and device compatibility. Here's a lean, resilient approach tailored for live performance or interactive apps like yours:

✅ Best Practices for Web MIDI Initialization
1. Use Async Initialization with Feedback
async function initMIDI() {
  try {
    showLoadingIndicator(); // Optional: UI feedback
    const access = await navigator.requestMIDIAccess({ sysex: false });
    handleMIDIAccess(access);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("MIDI initialization failed:", err);
    showErrorMessage("MIDI not available");
  } finally {
    hideLoadingIndicator();
  }
}


- Avoid blocking the main thread.
- Always wrap in try/catch to handle device or permission issues gracefully.

2. Defer Initialization Until User Interaction
Browsers often require a user gesture (like a button click) to allow MIDI access. This also avoids freezing during page load.
<button onclick="initMIDI()">Enable MIDI</button>



3. Throttle Device Enumeration
If you're listing inputs/outputs, avoid looping through them immediately. Wait for the statechange event or debounce your UI updates.
access.onstatechange = (event) => {
  // Debounce or batch updates here
  updateMIDIDeviceList(event.port);
};



4. Avoid Heavy DOM Updates During Initialization
If you're populating dropdowns or rendering device info, do it after MIDI access is granted — not during the request.

5. Test with Minimal Devices First
On systems with many MIDI ports (especially virtual ones), initialization can lag. Try disabling unused devices during testing.

6. Use WebMidi.js for Cleaner Flow (Optional)
If you're using WebMidi.js, it wraps the native API and simplifies error handling:
WebMidi.enable()
  .then(() => {
    console.log("WebMidi enabled");
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error("WebMidi error:", err);
  });
