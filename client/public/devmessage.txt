UI State Fix Applied (Sep 22, 5:19pm):
✅ Fixed UI not updating when MIDI devices connect
✅ Added delayed state reset to allow UI to properly refresh
✅ Connection status should now properly show Connected/Disconnect button
✅ Fixed TypeScript errors for better type safety

Please test: Click Connect on MidiPortA - it should connect and button should change to "Disconnect"

Previous fixes:
✅ Fixed infinite auto-reconnect loop - now truly one-shot
✅ Fixed ghost device detection - MidiPortA should appear as available
✅ Fixed auto-reconnect now skips Bluetooth devices during USB-only init

Previous Note: We are aware of a small glitch when you create a new song and add backing tracks the waveform doesnt appear until you select a different song and go back.
