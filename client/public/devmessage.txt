UI State Fix Applied (Sep 22, 5:41pm):
✅ Fixed button stuck on "Connecting..." - now prioritizes actual connection state over transient flags
✅ Added automatic reconciliation to clear stale connection states

Previous Note: We are aware of a small glitch when you create a new song and add backing tracks the waveform doesnt appear until you select a different song and go back.
