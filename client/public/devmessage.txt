UI State Fix Applied (Sep 22, 5:31pm):
✅ Fixed button stuck on "Connecting..." - now properly shows "Disconnect" when connected
✅ Removed timeouts that were delaying UI updates
✅ Button text now directly checks actual connection state from the hook

Previous Note: We are aware of a small glitch when you create a new song and add backing tracks the waveform doesnt appear until you select a different song and go back.
