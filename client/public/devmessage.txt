Mute Regions Fix Applied (Sep 22, 6:18pm):
✅ Fixed mute regions not persisting when switching songs - now properly saved and reloaded
✅ Tracks now retain volume, balance, mute, solo, and mute regions when switching songs

Previous Note: We are aware of a small glitch when you create a new song and add backing tracks the waveform doesnt appear until you select a different song and go back.
