UI State Fix Applied (Sep 22, 5:35pm):
✅ Fixed button stuck on "Connecting..." - state now properly resets to 'idle' after connection
✅ MIDI connections work perfectly - UI now correctly shows "Disconnect" when connected

Previous Note: We are aware of a small glitch when you create a new song and add backing tracks the waveform doesnt appear until you select a different song and go back.
