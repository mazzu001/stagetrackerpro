# RESTORE POINT: Complete Live Music Performance Application
**Created: August 22, 2025**
**Status: Excellent Build - Fully Functional**

# Overview
This project is a professional live music performance application built for stage use, featuring real-time audio mixing, advanced MIDI device management, and synchronized lyrics display. The application operates with complete offline capability, using local storage for all performance data and blob URLs for audio files. This build represents a fully functional, production-ready state with robust MIDI integration and comprehensive device management.

# Recent Major Improvements (August 2025)
## MIDI Command Format Standardization
- ✅ **Implemented new bracket format**: `[[PC:12:1]]`, `[[CC:7:64:1]]`, `[[NOTE:60:127:1]]`
- ✅ **Comprehensive MIDI parsing**: Supports Program Change, Control Change, Note On/Off with channel specification
- ✅ **Backward compatibility**: Legacy hex (`90 40 7F`) and text (`note on C4 127`) formats still supported
- ✅ **UI consistency**: All MIDI input fields updated with new format examples
- ✅ **Message formatting**: Incoming MIDI data displayed in readable bracket format

## Bluetooth Device Management Overhaul
- ✅ **All-device scanning**: Shows all Bluetooth devices, not just MIDI devices
- ✅ **Visual categorization**: Music icons for MIDI devices, Bluetooth icons for others
- ✅ **Smart device detection**: Recognizes MIDI devices by manufacturer keywords and device types
- ✅ **Priority sorting**: MIDI devices appear at top of device lists
- ✅ **Enhanced keyword detection**: Includes 'pedal', 'footswitch' for foot controllers

## UI/UX Improvements  
- ✅ **Text visibility fixed**: "Send MIDI Commands" now has proper contrast in light/dark modes
- ✅ **Consistent theming**: Dark/light mode support throughout application
- ✅ **Mobile optimization**: Touch-friendly controls for stage performance

# User Preferences
- **Communication style**: Simple, everyday language
